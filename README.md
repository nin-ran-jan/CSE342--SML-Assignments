# CSE342--SML-Assignments
The place where I started ML (and kind of loved it). Contains introductions and implementations of important state-of-the-art concepts in the ML domain like Gaussian probability theory, LDA, PCA, FDA, Feed Forward Neural Networks, Autoencoders, Decision Trees, etc. Course was taken by Dr. A V Subramanyam.
