# CSE342--SML-Assignments
The place where I started ML (and kind of loved it). 
Contains introductions and implementations of important state-of-the-art concepts in the ML domain like Gaussian probability theory, LDA, PCA, FDA, etc. 
Course was taken by Dr. A V Subramanyam here at IIIT Delhi.
For understanding what was done in each assignment, refer to the README files in each directory.
